<h2>Authorization with  LDAP</h2>
 
  <p>To provide authorization information from LDAP, 
  the LDAP directory must support the <code>posixGroup</code> schema.
  
  <p>Example LDAP entry:
  <pre>
  dn: cn=SetPVValue,ou=Groups,dc=example,dc=com
  objectClass: top
  objectClass: posixGroup
  cn: SetPVValue
  description: Allow writing to PV.
  gidNumber: 1234
  memberUid: fred
  memberUid: jane
  </pre>
  
  <p>The above entry defines a group "SetPVValue" with members
  "fred" and "jane".
  The LDAPGroupAuthorizationProvider will treat that
  as granting the <code>SetPVValue</code> authorization to users
  "fred" and "jane".
  
  <p>Note that members must specifically be listed via <code>memberUid</code>.
  In the above example, there may be a user with primary group ID <code>1234</code>
  that Linux would also consider to be a member of the "SetPVValue"
  Linux group, but for authorization purposes such a user must also be
  listed via <code>memberUid</code>. The numeric group ID is not used
  for authorization.
